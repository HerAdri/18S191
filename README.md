# 18.S191: Introduction to computational thinking for real-world problems

## Fall 2020

Welcome to the new MIT course 18.S191!

This is an introductory course on Computational Thinking, using the modern [Julia programming language](http://www.julialang.org), to approach real-world problems in the following areas via data analysis and computational and mathematical modeling:

- Image analysis
- Particle dynamics and ray tracing
- Epidemic propagation
- Climate modeling


### Course Materials
Course materials will be posted [here](syllabus.md).

Julia learning materials may be found [here](http://www.julialang.org/learning)

## Installation of Julia
You will need to install Julia by carefully following the detailed instructions [here](https://github.com/mitmath/18S191/blob/master/homework/homework00/Installing%20Julia%20%2B%20Pluto.md).



### Evaluation

*   12 weekly problem sets with equal weight; your lowest score will be dropped. 

*   Released on Thursdays and due before the following Thursday's class. (No problem set during Thanskgiving week.)

*   To pass, you must submit at least 11 problem sets with passing grades. 

*   No final exam

Problem sets consist of coding and will be submitted online via Canvas.
